# InDesign Paragraph styles discrepancies checker

This InDesign script allows me to check where are font size errors (a.k.a. overrides) between all of the Paragraph Styles in a document and each paragraph. The result is a .txt file which includes the page number, the first word of the paragraph, the content and the wrong size of the mistake.
